# Final Test Plan: Secure Concurrent Chat Application

This document outlines the comprehensive testing strategy for the chat application, focusing on functionality, concurrency, security, and error handling.

## 1. Basic Functionality Testing

### 1.1 Server Startup
- ✓ Server starts successfully with default parameters
- ✓ Server starts with custom port
- ✓ Server starts with custom users file
- ✓ Server loads user credentials correctly

### 1.2 Client Connection
- ✓ Client connects to server successfully
- ✓ Multiple clients can connect simultaneously
- ✓ Client displays appropriate welcome message
- ✓ Client handles connection refusal gracefully

### 1.3 Authentication
- ✓ Valid username/password allows login
- ✓ Invalid username is rejected
- ✓ Invalid password is rejected
- ✓ Commands before authentication are rejected
- ✓ Multiple authentication attempts work correctly

## 2. Chat Room Testing

### 2.1 Room Management
- ✓ List rooms shows correct available rooms
- ✓ Create room works successfully
- ✓ Creating duplicate room name is handled properly
- ✓ Join existing room works correctly
- ✓ Joining non-existent room is handled properly
- ✓ Leave room works correctly

### 2.2 Messaging
- ✓ Messages in a room are delivered to all members
- ✓ Messages don't leak to other rooms
- ✓ Join/leave notifications are broadcast correctly
- ✓ Message history is maintained properly
- ✓ Long messages are handled correctly
- ✓ Special characters in messages work correctly

## 3. Concurrency Testing

### 3.1 High Load Scenarios
- ✓ Multiple simultaneous connections (100+)
- ✓ Rapid room creation/joining/leaving
- ✓ High message throughput in a single room
- ✓ High message throughput across multiple rooms

### 3.2 Race Condition Testing
- ✓ Multiple clients creating rooms simultaneously
- ✓ Multiple clients joining/leaving simultaneously
- ✓ Multiple messages sent simultaneously
- ✓ Simultaneous operations on different rooms

## 4. AI Room Testing

### 4.1 AI Room Creation & Interaction
- ✓ Create AI room with prompt works correctly
- ✓ AI responds to messages appropriately
- ✓ AI responses are broadcast to all room members
- ✓ Multiple AI rooms function independently

### 4.2 AI Error Handling
- ✓ Handles Ollama service unavailable
- ✓ Handles slow AI responses
- ✓ Handles malformed AI responses
- ✓ Recovers from AI service temporary outages

## 5. Security Testing

### 5.1 TLS/SSL
- ✓ Secure connection established successfully
- ✓ Certificate validation works correctly
- ✓ Communication is properly encrypted
- ✓ Invalid certificates are rejected

### 5.2 Authentication Security
- ✓ Password is not visible in logs/console
- ✓ Session persistence after authentication
- ✓ Protection against brute force attacks

## 6. Error Handling Testing

### 6.1 Network Issues
- ✓ Server handles abrupt client disconnection
- ✓ Client handles server disconnection gracefully
- ✓ Reconnection attempts work properly
- ✓ Network timeouts are handled appropriately

### 6.2 Invalid Operations
- ✓ Invalid commands are reported clearly
- ✓ Unauthorized operations are rejected
- ✓ Resource limits are enforced (e.g., room capacity)

## 7. Resource Management Testing

### 7.1 Memory Usage
- ✓ No memory leaks under prolonged use
- ✓ Efficient memory usage with many connections
- ✓ Efficient memory usage with large message history

### 7.2 Thread Management
- ✓ Virtual threads are created/destroyed properly
- ✓ No thread leaks after client disconnection
- ✓ Thread pools scale appropriately under load

## 8. Graceful Shutdown Testing

### 8.1 Server Shutdown
- ✓ Server closes all connections properly
- ✓ Server releases all resources
- ✓ Connected clients are notified appropriately

### 8.2 Client Shutdown
- ✓ Client releases all resources on exit
- ✓ Client notifies server on intentional disconnect

## Testing Procedure

1. **Unit Tests**: Run automated tests for core components
2. **Integration Tests**: Test component interactions
3. **System Tests**: End-to-end functionality testing
4. **Load Tests**: Performance under high concurrency
5. **Security Tests**: Vulnerability assessment
6. **Edge Case Tests**: Boundary conditions and error cases

## Test Environment Setup

### Server Machine
- Java 21+
- Ollama installed and running
- SSL certificates generated
- Resource monitoring tools (JConsole, VisualVM)

### Client Machines
- Multiple physical/virtual machines
- Java 21+
- Network traffic analysis tools (optional)

## Test Data

- Sample user credentials in users.txt
- Pre-defined test messages of varying lengths
- AI prompts for testing AI room functionality

## Test Reporting

For each test case:
1. Expected outcome
2. Actual outcome
3. Pass/Fail status
4. Error messages or stack traces (if applicable)
5. Screenshots or logs as evidence

## Final Acceptance Criteria

- All critical and high-priority tests pass
- No memory leaks detected
- No thread management issues
- Proper error handling for all test cases
- Secure communication verified
- Performance acceptable under load
